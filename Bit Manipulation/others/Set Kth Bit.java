Set kth bit 

Given a number N and a value K. From the right, set the Kth bit in the binary representation of N. The position of Least Significant Bit(or last bit) is 0, the second last bit is 1 and so on. 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 10 
K = 2
Output:
14
Explanation:
Binary representation of the given number
10 is: 1 0 1 0, number of bits in the 
binary reprsentation is 4. Thus 2nd bit
from right is 0. The number after changing
this bit to 1 is: 14(1 1 1 0).

class Solution{
    static int setKthBit(int N,int K){
        // code here
      return(N|1<<K);
    }
}
