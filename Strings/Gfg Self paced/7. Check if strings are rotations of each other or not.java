Given two strings s1 and s2. The task is to check if s2 is a rotated version of the string s1. The characters in the strings are in lowercase.

 

Example 1:

Input:
geeksforgeeks
forgeeksgeeks
Output: 
1
Explanation: s1 is geeksforgeeks, s2 is
forgeeksgeeks. Clearly, s2 is a rotated
version of s1 as s2 can be obtained by
left-rotating s1 by 5 units.
  
  
  
  class Solution
{
    //Function to check if two strings are rotations of each other or not.
    public static boolean areRotations(String s1, String s2 )
    {
        // Your code here
        if(s1.length()!=s2.length())
        return false;
        return ((s1+s1).indexOf(s2)>=0);
        //returns +ve for index else negative for not found
    }
    
}//O(n)
